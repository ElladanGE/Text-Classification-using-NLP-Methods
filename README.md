# Text-Classification-using-NLP-Methods

In order to improve its user’s experience, programmer’s best friend Stackoverflow has begun to process internal
data from the past 15 years. Unfortunately, some data are missing; the tag i.e. the subject of a post is nowhere
to be found for some posts. To help them, you are mandate as machine learning (ML) specialists.
Here I build the most accurate ML models for predicting the missing tag of a post. In order to do so,
Stackoverflow has provided me with a data set of posts and associated tags. My main
challenge will be to process correctly these text data using natural language processing (NLP) methods.
